1. **Ignore the .box file**

  We'll use it later.

2. **Install for VirtualBox**

  You'll see a file named something like `VirtualBox-4.3.26-98988-OSX.dmg`,
  though the version might be different. Double-click that file to open it,
  then double-click the installer file that pops up. After the installer
  completes, eject the disk image.

3. **Install Vagrant**

  You'll see a file named something like `vagrant-1.7.2.dmg`, though the
  version might be different. Double-click that file to open it, then
  double-click the installer file that pops up. After the installer completes,
  eject the disk image.

4. **Install Sublime Text**

  Double-click the .dmg ("disk image") file to open it, then drag the
  Sublime Text app to your Applications folder. Then eject the disk
  image.
