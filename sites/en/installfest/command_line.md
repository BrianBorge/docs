# Finding and Using the Command Line

Finding the command line is a little different for each operating system. The
first step is to find the program that will allow you to access your computer's
command line.

## OS X

You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight (click the
magnifying glass in the top right of the screen and start typing
"Terminal"), or navigate to `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal` in Finder.

## Windows

Launch Git Bash via the shortcut on your Desktop, or locate **Git Bash**
in All Programs under Git. A new (mostly black) window will open.

Tip: Hit the Insert key to paste text into Git Bash. You will not be able
to copy and paste text into Git Bash when you are interacting with the
virtual machine.

## Linux

* Ubuntu: Click the Ubuntu logo and start typing "Terminal".
* Fedora: From the Main Menu bar select "Applications > System Tools > Terminal".

## Why do I need this?

You'll be using the command line throughout the workshop to build your web app.

Once you have the Terminal open, wait for the Command Line presentation and then
proceed to [set up your virtual machine](/installfest/set_up_virtual_machine).
