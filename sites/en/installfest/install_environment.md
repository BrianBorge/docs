# Install your Programming Environment

Choose the instructions below for your operating system. Most students will
have one of the operating systems in this row.

<table class="downloads-files">
  <tr>
    <th>Mac OS X (10.6+)</th>
    <th>Windows (7+)</th>
    <th>Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/osx">Mac OS X Setup</a> instructions</td>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/windows_7">Windows (7+) Setup</a> instructions</td>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/linux">Linux Setup</a> instructions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you have one of the operating systems in the next row below, let a TA know,
in case we need to offer extra assistance.

<table class="downloads-files">
<tr>
  <th>Mac OS X (10.4-10.5)</th>
  <th>Linux</th>
  <th>Windows XP</th>
  <th>ChromeOS (Chromebook)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="4" style="text-align:center">Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Amazon Cloud9 instead</a>.
</tr>
</table>

## Next Step

STOP here! It's time to learn how to use the command line. Once the presentation
is over, continue to continue to [Setting Up Your Virtual
Machine](/installfest/set_up_virtual_machine).
