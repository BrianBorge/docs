### Goal

**Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding**

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and
run Ruby code. Work through these sections in order, and ask questions if you
get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the steps, find a TA to go through the
[checklist] with you.

[checklist]: /installfest/checklist

### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

First, make sure you have downloaded the files for your operating system from
the <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a>. If you don't have them, you can get them
from a TA with a USB drive.

Then, go to the [Install your Environment](/installfest/install_environment) page
and run the installation programs for your OS.

### 2. Learn How to Use the Command Line

Once you've installed all the software, [find your way to the
Terminal](/installfest/command_line) and stay tuned for a presentation on how to
use it!

### 3. Set up your Virtual Machine

Follow the instructions in the [VM Setup page](set_up_virtual_machine).

### 4. Try your Text Editor

You've installed Sublime Text, a text editor that is designed for coding. We have some suggestions
for using it more effectively on [this page](install_a_text_editor).

### 5. Setup Checklist

Find a TA and run through the
[Installfest Completion Checklist](checklist).
