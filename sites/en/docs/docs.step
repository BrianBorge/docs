# RailsBridge curriculum-related FAQ

### Can I use the RailsBridge curricula at my event?

Anyone can use this site! It's under a Creative Commons license ([CC-BY,  specifically](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)), which means you're welcome to share, remix, or use our content commercially. We just ask for attribution.

Slightly different: if you're organizing an event and wonder if it could be considered a RailsBridge Workshop, we have two requirements:

* The event should be free of charge.
* The event should target a group of people that is underrepresented in tech, such as LGBTQ folks, women, black or latin@ people, or others.

If you're not doing those two things, you can totally still use the site, we just ask that you not call your event a RailsBridge workshop.
(Charity workshops have used "Rails Workshop featuring the RailsBridge curriculum" in the past, which is neat.)


### I want to help, but I don't know how.

First, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/). Then,
[create an issue](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/docs/issues) with the
idea you have. We'll help you turn it into reality (assuming it's in line with
our lofty goals :D).

Don't know what you could work on? Browse the
[issues list](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/docs/issues) and the
[To Do list](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/docs/wiki/RailsBridge-To-Do-List).
Those have lots of ideas.


### I have a different question about RailsBridge.

The [RailsBridge website](http://www.railsbridge.org) probably has an answer!
